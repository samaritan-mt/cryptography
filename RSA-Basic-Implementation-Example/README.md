# Textbook Implementation of RSA using Python 

### Author : Saad Moutaouakil

*** 

This script aims to familiarize with the RSA public-key algorithm.

It contains a prime number generator based on the Miller-Rabin primality test.

The implementation works with very short plaintexts using only lowercase characters. 

I will work on a V2 as soon as possible to handle multiple characters and numbers.
